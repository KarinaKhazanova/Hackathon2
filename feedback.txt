Hello Karina this is the hackaton feedback. I like the hangman game it is a nice project to do. Maybe you could had use
the open method with files or an api to introduce infinite words in to your project. You even have an example in the 
classes working with anagrams where you could download a file full of words. Then if the word have two times 
the same letter i have to select the letter two times also and that is not a  normal behave for a hangman game. 
You can also show the user all the letters he already selected as incorrect after every turn. Your game is ok but
i would expect a  more advanced solution for a hangman project. 

Thanks for sharing your project and keep coding.
